            <h2>My North Star</h2>
            <p>I graduated with a Bachelors in Digital Media, from the class of 2024 at University of Houston. Right after graduating I was hired by a graphic design company called Bravo located in Singapore.<br>
            Some of thier specialties were concept development, content and strategy, and motion and animation.I worked remotley and worked my way up through different companies to reach where I am today.</p>
            <p>Since then I have tried looking for jobs that promised recognition. For the postion I am right now, I believe I have made the right decisions in life.<br>
            Though I have had some setbacks due to personal reasons, I have never let anything come in the way of me and my dream, which is to be the best in what I do.</p>

            <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
            <p>My plans for the future I hope to be at a better position and one day own my own design company. I would like to have different departments in one franchise, in different states, and countries so that everyone can get the oppurtunity to work from where they are able to.<br>
            I would also like to offer the choice to work remote, for the individuals that prefer to work from home. Here are some examples of jobs that would be offered:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Illustrator</li>
                <li>Web Designer</li>
                <li>2D Animaition</li>
                <li>3D Animation</li>
                <li>Sound Artists</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I want to own a company where anyone is able to do what they like in terms of technology. I would like to have a vast selection of postions and departments. This will create unity amongst the colleagues and staff.</p>
